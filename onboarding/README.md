# RPI onboarding to Mindsphere
## Methods
1. Mindsphere Image file
2. MindConnect IoT extension
3. Using open source mindconnect libraries - (c and nodejs)

## Tests
1. Method 1 - Mindsphere Image file

- [Documentation](https://documentation.mindsphere.io/resources/html/start-for-free/en-US/136504183435.html)
- Installing the custom image from mindsphere is okay but the device fails to boot and thus this method was scrapped off

2. Method 2 - MindConnect IoT extension
- [Documentation](https://developer.mindsphere.io/howto/howto-rpi-mciot.html)
- This method requires the MindConnect IoT Extension which is a paid extension (69$/month) thus this was also scrapped off

3. Method 3 - mindconnect libraries - (c and nodejs)
- [Documentation](https://developer.mindsphere.io/resources/mindconnect-lib/resources-mclib-overview.html)
- The libraries are: [C](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/document/109755348/mindconnect-library-3-1-for-mindsphere-3-0-?dti=0&lc=en-WW) and [NodeJs](https://github.com/mindsphere/mindconnect-nodejs)
