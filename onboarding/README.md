# RPI onboarding to Mindsphere
## Methods
1. Mindsphere Image file
2. MindConnect IoT extension
3. Using open source mindconnect libraries - (c and nodejs)

## Tests
1. Method 1
Installing the custom image from mindsphere is okay but the device fails to boot and thus this method was scrapped off

2. Method 2 
This method requires the MindConnect IoT Extension which is a paid extension (69$/month) thus this was also scrapped off

3. Method 3
